# SimpleInvoices\Mvc

It is a modified version of Zend\Mvc.

The best way to do it would be to create some Simple Invoices logic and use the original Zend\Mvc, however, while porting the application from it's original state it was easier to include code a step at a time and that's how this namespace was borned.

TODO: Create the logic to use the original Zend\Mvc for easier maintenance.
